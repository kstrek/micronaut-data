As mentioned in the <<mongoQuickStart, Quick Start>> section, if you need to customize how entities map to the table and column names of the database you need use Micronaut Data's own annotations in the `io.micronaut.data.annotation` package.

An important aspect of Micronaut Data Mongo is that the entity classes must be compiled with Micronaut Data. This is because Micronaut Data pre-computes the persistence model (the relationships between entities, the class/property name to collection/attribute name mappings) at compilation time, which is one of the reasons Micronaut Data Mongo can startup so fast.

An example of mapping with Micronaut Data annotations can be seen below:
