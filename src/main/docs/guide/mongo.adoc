Micronaut Data Mongo supports most of the things that are possible to do with JPA and JDBC/R2DBC implementations, including:

- Repositories with compile-time generated filtering, aggregation and projection queries
- Entities relations and cascading
- Transactions
- JPA Criteria API

In the first version of Micronaut Data Mongo only synchronous Mongo driver is supported.
